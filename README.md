# Text-Based Adventure Game in C++
A linear text-based adventure game written in C++. It features: 
- Random generation of events for the player to tackle, such as battling an enemy, or finding a potion to drink; 
- A full combat system in which the player can choose between three options; 
- A wide array of enemy types that each attack in different ways. 

The goal of the game is to reach the treasure room of the castle before you run out of hit points. Movement through the castle is dealt with automatically, but it is the player's responsibility to deal with the hazards that the castle has to offer!
